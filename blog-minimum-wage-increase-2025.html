            <h1>Minimum Wage Rises to £12.71: What It Means for Your Take-Home Pay and Mortgage</h1>
            <p class="blog-intro">Tomorrow's Budget brings welcome news for minimum wage workers: the hourly rate for over-21s will rise by 50p to £12.71. Here's exactly how much extra you'll take home, and what it means for first-time buyers.</p>
        </div>

        <img src="images/markus-winkler-Ber3q-zEhd4-unsplash.jpg" alt="Minimum wage increase 2025 budget" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; margin: 2rem auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px;">

        <div class="calculator-card">
            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>We've crunched the numbers for workers doing 30, 40, and 50 hours per week to show exactly how much extra you'll have in your pocket after tax and National Insurance.</p>

                <h2>Take-home pay at the new £12.71 rate</h2>
                
                <p>Here's what you'll actually take home at the new hourly rate, compared to the current £12.21 rate, working 52 weeks per year:</p>

                <p><strong>30 hours per week:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual gross salary: £19,828</li>
                    <li>Annual take-home pay: £17,795</li>
                    <li>Monthly take-home: <strong>£1,483</strong></li>
                    <li>Net increase: <strong>+£561/year (+£47/month)</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>40 hours per week (full-time):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual gross salary: £26,437</li>
                    <li>Annual take-home pay: £22,555</li>
                    <li>Monthly take-home: <strong>£1,880</strong></li>
                    <li>Net increase: <strong>+£749/year (+£62/month)</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>50 hours per week:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual gross salary: £33,046</li>
                    <li>Annual take-home pay: £27,313</li>
                    <li>Monthly take-home: <strong>£2,276</strong></li>
                    <li>Net increase: <strong>+£936/year (+£78/month)</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Working full-time at 40 hours per week, you'll take home £1,880 per month—that's £62 more each month than before, or £749 extra over the year. The increase isn't quite the full £1,040 gross boost because of income tax (20%) and National Insurance (8%) on earnings above £12,570.</p>

                <h2>Can minimum wage workers get a mortgage?</h2>
                
                <p>With house prices remaining high, we've looked at mortgage affordability for minimum wage earners. Lenders typically offer 4 to 4.5 times your annual salary.</p>

                <p><strong>Single person (40 hours/week):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual salary: £26,437</li>
                    <li>Potential mortgage: <strong>£105,750 – £119,000</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Couple (both on minimum wage, 40 hours/week each):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Combined annual salary: £52,874</li>
                    <li>Potential mortgage: <strong>£211,500 – £238,000</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>For a single person on minimum wage, getting on the property ladder remains challenging in much of the UK. However, a couple both working full-time on minimum wage could potentially borrow enough for a first home in many areas outside London and the South East. With shared ownership options, homeownership isn't completely out of reach.</p>

                <h2>Making the most of your pay rise</h2>
                
                <p>Whether you pocket the extra £62/month or use it strategically, every bit helps. Consider putting it towards building an emergency fund, contributing to a Lifetime ISA for a house deposit (and get a 25% government bonus), or paying down any high-interest debt.</p>

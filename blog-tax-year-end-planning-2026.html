            <h1>Tax Year End Checklist: 5 Things to Do Before 5 April 2026</h1>
            <p class="blog-intro">The 2025/26 tax year ends on 5 April 2026. Many valuable tax allowances are &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; &mdash; if you don&rsquo;t claim them before the deadline, they&rsquo;re gone for good. Here are five essential things every UK taxpayer should do before the clock runs out.</p>
        </div>

        <img src="images/towfiqu-barbhuiya-0ITvgXAU5Oo-unsplash.jpg" alt="Tax year end planning 2026" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; margin: 2rem auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px;">

        <div class="calculator-card">
            <div class="blog-content">

                <h2>1. Max out your ISA allowance (£20,000)</h2>
                
                <p>Every UK adult can shelter up to £20,000 in ISAs each tax year, completely free from income tax and capital gains tax. Once 5 April passes, your unused 2025/26 allowance vanishes — you can't carry it forward.</p>
                
                <p>Even if you can only put away a small amount, it's worth doing. A Cash ISA earning 4.5% on £20,000 generates £900 in tax-free interest per year. Outside an ISA, a higher-rate taxpayer would pay £360 of that to HMRC.</p>

                <p>If you're saving for a first home, consider a <strong>Lifetime ISA</strong> where the government adds a 25% bonus on top (up to £1,000 free per year on a £4,000 contribution).</p>

                <h2>2. Check your income tax position</h2>
                
                <p>The personal allowance for 2025/26 remains at <strong>£12,570</strong>. If you earn between £100,000 and £125,140, your personal allowance is gradually withdrawn — losing £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000. This creates an effective 60% marginal tax rate.</p>

                <p><strong>If you're near the £100,000 threshold:</strong> Making a pension contribution before 5 April can bring your adjusted net income below £100,000 and restore your full personal allowance — potentially saving you thousands.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal allowance: <strong>£12,570</strong></li>
                    <li>Basic rate (20%): £12,571 – £50,270</li>
                    <li>Higher rate (40%): £50,271 – £125,140</li>
                    <li>Additional rate (45%): Over £125,140</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Use our <a href="income-tax-calculator.html" style="color: var(--primary-color); font-weight: 600;">Income Tax Calculator</a> to see exactly where you stand and how a pension top-up could help.</p>

                <h2>3. Use your capital gains allowance (£3,000)</h2>
                
                <p>The capital gains tax-free allowance has been slashed to just <strong>£3,000</strong> for 2025/26 (down from £6,000 last year and £12,300 just two years ago). If you have investments with unrealised gains, consider selling enough to use this year's allowance before it resets.</p>

                <p>You can immediately reinvest in different holdings — just be aware of the "bed and breakfast" rules that prevent you selling and rebuying the exact same shares within 30 days to crystallise a gain.</p>

                <h2>4. Top up your pension</h2>
                
                <p>You can contribute up to <strong>£60,000</strong> into your pension this tax year (or 100% of your earnings, whichever is lower) and receive tax relief. If you haven't used your full allowance from the previous three tax years, you may be able to carry it forward — potentially contributing even more.</p>

                <p>For a higher-rate taxpayer, a £10,000 pension contribution effectively costs just £6,000 after tax relief. That's an instant 67% return before any investment growth.</p>

                <h2>5. Review your expenses if you're self-employed</h2>
                
                <p>If you're self-employed or run a side business, make sure you've recorded all allowable expenses for the 2025/26 tax year. Common claims people miss include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Working from home allowance (flat rate of £6/week = £312/year)</li>
                    <li>Professional subscriptions and memberships</li>
                    <li>Business mileage at 45p per mile (first 10,000 miles)</li>
                    <li>Phone and broadband (business proportion)</li>
                    <li>Training courses related to your current trade</li>
                </ul>
